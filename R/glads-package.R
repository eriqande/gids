#' Genomic Landscape of Divergence Simulation
#'
#' The pkg{glads} package is an individual-based framework for forward demographic, genetic and genomic simulations.
#' The main aim of the R package is to simulate the divergence of populations further in time, elucidating genomic patterns that may be generated by a range of demographic and genetic processes.
#'
#' The list of functions can be displayed with \code{library(help = glads)}.
#'
#' The main function of the pkg{glads} is \code{"evolve"}, which allows the forward simulation of the genetic structure of populations under various scenarios of drift and selection.
#' The supported data are allelic frequencies, SNPs or sequences of DNA.
#' User may either simulate a theoretical dataset or directly work with their own empirical observations.
#' In any case, the observation should be arranged in a two-dimensional array that represents a pair of homologous chromosomes. Each element of the array is an integer defining the copy of a given allele at a given locus.
